Description: A tool to automate the creation of suitable stage 1 init binaries for s6-based Linux systems.
 s6-linux-init is a set of minimalistic tools to create a s6-based init system, including a /sbin/init binary, on a
 Linux kernel. s6-linux-init is meant to automate creation of scripts revolving around the use of other skarnet.org
