Description: skarnet's small supervision suite
 s6 is a small suite of programs for UNIX, designed to allow process
 supervision (a.k.a service supervision), in the line of daemontools and runit,
 as well as various operations on processes and daemons. It is meant to be a
 toolbox for low-level process and service administration, providing different
 sets of independent tools that can be used within or without the framework,
 and that can be assembled together to achieve powerful functionality with a
 very small amount of code.
